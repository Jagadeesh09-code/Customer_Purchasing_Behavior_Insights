# Customer_Purchasing_Behavior_Insights
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, starting from loading raw data in Python to delivering a polished business report and presentation. The goal is to analyze customer purchasing patterns, uncover behavioral insights, and support data-driven decision-making through visualizations, SQL analysis, and dashboarding.

The workflow reflects real industry practices used by Data Analysts, Business Analysts, and BI professionals.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains retail transaction records, including:

Customer demographics (age, gender, location, subscription status)

Purchase details (product, category, price, season, color, size)

Behavioral indicators (discounts, shipping type, review ratings, frequency)

This diverse data enables deep exploration of spending trends, product preferences, and customer segments.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) — Data loading, EDA, cleaning

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server — Structured data analysis via SQL queries

Power BI — Interactive data visualization dashboard

Gamma.ai — Final presentation deck

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code — Development environment

GitHub — Version control and project documentation

🛠️ Project Steps
1. Data Loading (Python)

Imported dataset using pandas

Performed initial inspection with .info(), .describe(), .head()

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions and correlations

Identified outliers and missing values

Visualized key trends using charts and plots

3. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Imputed missing values

Standardized column names

Created new fields such as age groups and purchase frequency

Validated data types and removed redundancies

4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Imported cleaned dataset into SQL for deeper business insights:

Revenue comparison across demographics

High-value customer identification

Subscription behavior insights

Most profitable product categories

Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)

5. Power BI Dashboard

Developed an interactive dashboard including:

Revenue by customer traits

Top-rated and best-selling products

Discount usage behavior

Customer segmentation breakdown

Seasonality and trend visualizations

6. Report & Presentation

Summarized findings, insights, and recommendations in a project report

Created a professional presentation using Gamma for stakeholder communication

📈 Results & Insights

Key findings include:

Female customers show slightly higher revenue contribution

Express shipping customers spend significantly more

Subscribers generate higher average revenue and stronger repeat behavior

Loyal customers, although fewer, create the highest lifetime value

Discounts remain a strong purchase motivator across categories

These insights drive strategic recommendations such as enhancing loyalty programs, improving subscription features, and targeting high-value segments.
